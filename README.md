USRA
====

Here you can find work from my summer project, for which I've received an Undergraduate Student Research Award. The project involves calculating the VC Dimension (it's complicated) of various families of sets. The part for which I'm writing code is all about trying to find non-epsilon-nets (not as complicated, but still tricky). 

<h3> What You'll Find</h3>
I've uploaded a few choice scripts for finding non-epsilon-nets for sets of disks in the plane, 4-balls in R^4, and some sets of p-adic annuli in Z_p. You can also find my end of summer report, which outlines the more theoretical aspects of the project in pretty simple terms. I've also uploaded some general-purpose code for Monte Carlo Integration and Simulated Annealing.

If you've ended up here (and frankly I'm not sure why you have, since there are probably 5 people worldwide who care about this project and 4 of them are already my collaborators), then hopefully you find something of interest. 

<h3> Enjoy! </h3>
